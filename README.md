# machine-learning
 Experiments ran to clarify some concepts associated with Machine Learning:

 1. PS1 addresses:
    - Is it always a good idea to remove extreme values from a sample so that the sample mean is closer to the population mean?
    - The curse of dimensionality: as the number of dimensions of a d-dimensional cube grows, so do the distances between the points and the angles between the vector associated with the different points tend to become orthogonal.

2. PS2 studies the risk associated with k-NN

3. In PS3 we build a perceptron from scratch and evaluate how it behaves for separable and non separable cases in terms of running times and probabilities of error.

4. PS4 compares Ordinay Least Squares to (Stochastic) Gradient Descent in terms of risk and running times.
